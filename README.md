## Description
### Purpose:
A portfolio website which provides an overview of my skills, interests, web/coding projects and contact information.

### Functionality / features:

- An Interests page, featuring an image grid/gallery, to display some of my hobbies and interests
- A Projects page, which features some of my web/coding projects so far, including links and screenshots for these
- A Blog page, which I decided to write a few coding/IT related things on

### Target audience:
I have intended this portfolio website mainly for prospective employers or other people to network with in IT or coding, but I treated the Interests and Blog sections a bit like a social media profile, since I don't really use Facebook and Instagram etc. anymore, so maybe others outside of IT and coding.

### Tech stack:
html, css, uicolors, GitHub Pages
