  <h3>"Thoughts on this portfolio assignment" Posted: 20-03-2024 4:00PM</h3>

  <p>So far, the most difficult parts of this assignment have been the file coordination and SSH keys. I still
    got confused and unsure about this earlier on. I'm still a bit unsure how the zip folder will work for submitting, 
    along with the file/s for Github and deployment. My SSH key from the last 6 or so months wasn't working apparently 
    when trying to push or pull or clone from Github, so had to look up articles and guidelines about this, and get a new one.
    In terms of designing this website, my knowledge of HTML and CSS is ok enough now to complete this fairly easily. I still 
    referred to a few articles and examples to remind me and a bit of trial and error to get things looking right enough, not
    as wonky. I assume we might be adding functions, eg. JavaScript, to this portfolio site in coming months? I was thinking if I
    could, eg. for this Blog section. My understanding of this is still a bit limited, but I'd imagine it would be Express.js for this purpose.

  <h3>"Thoughts on this Coder Academy course, comparison with edX/University of Adelaide" Posted: 21-03-2024 4:30PM</h3>

  <p>
  I decided to do this Coder Academy course at the moment, because some of the edX/University of Adelaide course was a bit
  rushed. It had a very good main instructor, and the classes (my class at least) were smaller, 15 people, reduced to about 10 when people dropped out.
  So it was a bit easier to ask questions directly to him, but some of the topics really needed 2 or 3 weeks to understand probably, instead of the one week, 
  new topic each week. Mid last year I was deciding whether to do Coder Academy or edX/University of Adelaide or both, and by December last year, I decided
  I should probably do both, to familiarize with some of the topics some more, and a bit better/Australian networking and the placements. Also I have sometimes looked
  up some of the jobs, eg. "entry level" jobs, related to IT/coding, which often still require some experience, eg. 6 months or 2 years, so another reason I 
  decided to do this extra 10 months of study/experience. And it looks like a few things will be covered in this course which weren't covered in edX/University of Adelaide,
  such as Ruby and Python.

  <h3>"Why I decided to study coding recently" Posted: 21-03-2024 5:00PM</h3>

  <h4>Photo by Clément Hélardot on Unsplash</h4>
  <p>When I was in school and uni 15-20 years ago, I didn't think I would be working in IT so much, and wasn't so much interested in it. But in the last 7 or 8 years I have 
  been involved in a few IT or coding-related projects, projects which touched on this, such as SEO or other web content. And I'm aware this would be an industry with increasing demand 
  for workforce, such as for working with AI. So this is the first time I have properly learnt coding, the full process, and I could see myself getting more-so into IT work, as a suitable
  occupation for me. I have had some other interests for jobs over the years but not been accepted so far, such as aviation, media, film. I've never had the money (up to $100,000 approx. for commercial licence)
  for training as a pilot, and wasn't as good with maths and physics, B or C level, same for the ATC test. I have expressed interest in ramp agent a few times but not been accepted, probably
  because I'm of smaller build, so not as good for baggage/freight handling, and I wasn't as sure about the 24/7 rotating roster, since I have a dodgy sleeping pattern. I'll also probably 
  never be good with customer service roles, as I possibly have "mild" Aspergers according to my mother and some tests. But IT/coding seems quite suitable for me. I don't mind spending hours completing/creating
  something and problem-solving.
