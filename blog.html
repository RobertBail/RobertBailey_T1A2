  <h3>"Thoughts on this portfolio assignment" Posted: 20-03-2024 4:00PM</h3>

  <p>So far, the most difficult parts of this assignment have been the file coordination and SSH keys. I still
    got confused and unsure about this earlier on. I'm still a bit unsure how the zip folder will work for submitting, 
    along with the file/s for Github and deployment. My SSH key from the last 6 or so months wasn't working apparently 
    when trying to push or pull or clone from Github, so had to look up articles and guidelines about this, and get a new one.
    In terms of designing this website, my knowledge of HTML and CSS is ok enough now to complete this fairly easily. I still 
    referred to a few articles and examples to remind me and a bit of trial and error to get things looking right enough, not
    as wonky. I assume we might be adding functions, eg. JavaScript, to this portfolio site in coming months? I was thinking if I
    could, eg. for this Blog section. My understanding of this is still a bit limited, but I'd imagine it would be Express.js for this purpose.

  <h3>"Thoughts on this Coder Academy course, comparison with edX/University of Adelaide" Posted: 21-03-2024 4:30PM</h3>

  <p>
  I decided to do this Coder Academy course at the moment, because some of the edX/University of Adelaide course was a bit
  rushed. It had a very good main instructor, and the classes (my class at least) were smaller, 15 people, reduced to about 10 when people dropped out.
  So it was a bit easier to ask questions directly to him, but some of the topics really needed 2 or 3 weeks to understand probably, instead of the one week, 
  new topic each week. Mid last year I was deciding whether to do Coder Academy or edX/University of Adelaide or both, and by December last year, I decided
  I should probably do both, to familiarize with some of the topics some more, and a bit better/Australian networking and the placements. Also I have sometimes looked
  up some of the jobs, eg. "entry level" jobs, related to IT/coding, which often still require some experience, eg. 6 months or 2 years, so another reason I 
  decided to do this extra 10 months of study/experience. And it looks like a few things will be covered in this course which weren't covered in edX/University of Adelaide,
  such as Ruby and Python.
